Just your run of the mill X11/dwm install script with my preferences. Comes with my neovim configuration and other apps.

# Installation

Run the install.sh script as a super user inside the dotfiles directory!

Warning: This script is intended for a fresh install of Arch Linux, this may cause damage if it is not on a fresh Arch install.
