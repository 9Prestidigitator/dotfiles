# Notes
This is more for my own personal thoughts.
## Purpose
A one stop shop script to syncronize my configurations and packages for my Arch and Debian systems.
## Goals
I kind of want to redo my isntallation script to:
- Automatically detect what distro it's being run on.
- Have a terminal checklist GUI that sets bash variables pre-emptively then installs, after confirmation, all at once. This makes installation safer.

    - Reaper config
